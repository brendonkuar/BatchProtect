# DataBreached-Game-
A command prompt based horror game I am developing and constantly updating.

I am going to add protection to it before or after I convert it from .BAT to .EXE
Reason for this is because it's a storyline based horror game and modifying the game will not make it fun.
The game is not as easy to make only because there's no music and such, but I try to add as much as possible.

- Added a menu with a login system
- Added a button that lets you play the game

SOON
- Protection against crackers
- More story
- Fixes
- Hidden stuff ;)
